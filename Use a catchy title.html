            <p class="abstract" id="a">This thesis is a result of my 
research on a subject that has always been a fascination to me. 
Nevertheless I got completely lost in a&nbsp;world of my very own words,
 explanations,&nbsp;ideas, and&nbsp;probably even misconceptions. I 
started my research on the subject of language. There is something 
appealing to me about the way in which it fails to explain the world and
 our emotions.&nbsp;During my research I was quite&nbsp;surprised by a 
discovery. Apparently&nbsp;&nbsp;the word communication comes from the 
latin “communicare”, which literally translates “to share”. As a graphic
 design student, it is far from surprising that I was so fascinated by 
this little detail. I have spent the last four years learning about the 
practice of communication, and I never knew what it actually means. 
I&nbsp;had to ask myself: Do I master the practice of&nbsp;communication
 or does it master me? 
             </p>
            <p class="abstract" id="aa">
            I&nbsp;try to understand to what extent can media shrink our
 perception?&nbsp;How do the communication tools we use give form to and
 alter our thoughts? How much do we actually engage with the people 
around and what does it say about our society.&nbsp;The ways in which we
 interact are a vehicle for defining our personal and cultural identity.
 The tools we use to communicate and to distribute information create a 
world where human interaction becomes dependent on and therefore limited
 to them. Talking is distortion of air but does that mean we can never 
speak in vaccum?&nbsp;</p>

result in a closed and settled perspective, leading to not moving beyond
 the way in which we perceive and deal with problems. For example in the
 case with babies. We can’t have a conversation with them, because they 
don’t have any knowledge on the medium of spoken language.</span> <span class="tothink">That
 doesn’t mean a baby doesn’t have thoughts or anything to say to us. 
Babies never resemble a blank canvas. The beginning of their cognition 
process is their beginning. Babies’ capacities for feeling originate 
through interaction in the moment they are formed in the womb. It could 
even be that their thinking (cognition) is even greater than ours, since
 it is not mediated through human language.</span></p>

 invent those at the moment of their interaction. Most of the time to us
 it sounds like nonsense, but it’s impossible to deny that they do 
exchange some meaning.</span></span> We are just too biased by our 
knowledge of institutionalised language norms to possibly understand it 
and engage in such a conversation. They are even much better at sensing 
other people’s emotions than grown up’s can ever be. The act of 
imitation is important in the newborns world.  At the beginning  babies 
imitate the facial expressions that they see and express themselves 
using this “language”. It is interesting that these facial expressions 
are very similar across  all cultures. There seems to be universal 
expressions for the emotions of fear, sadness, joy, disgust, and anger. 
It appears that the human face speaks a sort of a universal language of 
expressions and babies use it to communicate to us before they know how 
to speak. [7]</p>

them as a view of one solid  three dimensional object or space. The

possibilities.</span></span> <span class="tothink">In a book “Creativity
 flow and the psychology of discovery and invention”,&nbsp;Mihaly 
Csikszentmihalyi explains the phenomena of&nbsp;creativity as something 
that does not happen inside people’s heads, but in the interaction 
between a person’s thoughts and a sociocultural context.</span> <span class="participation">Creativity
 is&nbsp;experiencing the world in novel and original ways.&nbsp;When we
 create something, we do not create it from nothing. We take existing 
materials or ideas and use, transform, merge them accordingly to a 
vision that we have.&nbsp;Creativity is the working of our imagination 
in context. Imagination is closely&nbsp;related to reality. The 
connection&nbsp;lies in the opportunity that based upon reality, 
imagination provides innovation and possibilities. It helps us&nbsp;to 
distance&nbsp;ourself from the situation and&nbsp;understand that things
 can be different. When our imagination is at work we are able to 
envision possibilities.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="toshare">Imagination
 is an essential part of communication. It inspires our thinking and the
 way we perceive, engage, produce&nbsp;and interact with 
the&nbsp;environment, situation or people. We imagine the others through
 sympathy. That mean to identify with them. When we say&nbsp;“I can 
imagine how you feel.” Imagination unfolds human perception and 
experience in unexpected ways.</span></p>

interesting for me because it is simply weird and expresses a lot of 
sense, while being very irrational. Usually the use of the teapot 
happens according to the rules imposed by it’s design. It is intended to
 be used in a particular way. We must lift the pot with a hand, position
 it over the cup and than pour into it. The teapot is the medium for 
serving tea. It’s&nbsp;well thought form defines the possible ways in 
which the teapot could be used. But to show one thing means 
simultaneously to conceal something else. There might be many other ways

the same root, was aimed to encourage learning as a form of play 
(paidia) which was considered the most effective approach to learning 
for the free citizens of the society.&nbsp;<span class="participation">We
 can even go as far as to position a reciprocal relationship between a 
society and the games it likes to play. Many games do not imply 
rules,&nbsp;such as playing with locomotives, cars, dolls, puppets and 
other. These games&nbsp;stimulate improvisation, and are a play for 
play’s sake. But in this play fiction is becoming a rule of it’s own. 
The rule of “as if”. [19]</span> People find children to be 
the&nbsp;ultimate creative explorers because of their 
constant&nbsp;curiosity and&nbsp;the&nbsp;interest&nbsp;they invest on 
anything within range. They are delighted by the unknown. The way in 
which children learn is by playing. <span class="participation">By&nbsp;interacting
 with&nbsp;their environment children engage in a feedback with the 
subject of their exploration and learn by the immediate exchange. It 
could be that their play is so creative because they are not completely

form of interaction with the environment. <span class="toshare">This

            <p class="paragraph">I thought of talking about walls. <span class="intermediate">A
 wall is a defined as a structure built for&nbsp;defence. From&nbsp;old 
English&nbsp;- a divider. The wall is meant to divide space or to be a 
border between the outside and the inside (of a house, for 
example).&nbsp;Walls are the artificial borders of the world.</span> <span class="alter">They
 have a very strong political connotation as well. It seems to be a 
trendy way to brag about power. And that’s how wall get raised to divide
 people and land and become barriers to communication and social 
interaction.</span><span class="character"> Nevertheless in the process 
of their existence the character of walls takes on a different meaning. 
They become street galleries, where anyone can be an artist and express 
their creativity in public space.&nbsp;From means of separation, the 
wall turns into a space for open communication, criticism and personal 
expression. There are many walls in the world.&nbsp;But&nbsp;maybe there
 are many&nbsp;more&nbsp;people taking on these walls and opening up 
public space.</span></p>

            <p class="paragraph">In the history of art there are many 
movements that try to escape the&nbsp;institutionalisation of 
art&nbsp;and to create space for free, living art.&nbsp;The Dada and 
Fluxus artist for example promoted art forms that were outside of the 
norms&nbsp;imposed by cultural institutions, media production and high 
art. <span class="character">By&nbsp;engaging in self - 
defined&nbsp;artistic&nbsp;practices they&nbsp;broadened 
the&nbsp;understanding of what can be considered as&nbsp;art. Fluxus 
encouraged a “do-it-yourself”&nbsp;aesthetic. They refused the romantic 
idea of the artist as an individual with an outstanding gift and aimed 
not only to make art available to the masses, but wanted to engage them 
as active participants in it’s production.</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="draggable_text ui-draggable ui-draggable-handle"> 
            <p class="paragraph">Fluxus art discredited the conventional
 market-driven art world. They have created their own means of 
expression and production, overcoming the existing codes for the 
definition of art.&nbsp;Fluxus artists claimed their work to be 
“anti-art,” in order to emphasize the revolutionary mode of thinking 
about the practice and process, which involves 
a&nbsp;broadened&nbsp;understanding on the importance of art in the 
social&nbsp;context and the importance of immediate interaction.</p>

 If we want to experience the world in a different way we must first 
start doing, seeing, feeling and thinking differently. The ways in which
 we interact and thereby create and share meaning are a vehicle for 
defining our personal and cultural identity. <span class="word">When we express
            ourselves, we stuff our thought in empty words, we use tools communicate and to distribute
            information, but that creates a world where human interaction becomes dependent on
            these tools and therefore limited to them. They have the power to shrink the understanding
            between us because there is no shared experience.</span></p>

            to our common experience, rather than to dominate it. When people engage and
